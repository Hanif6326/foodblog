                        <p>I’m the type of indecisive person who can never pick favorites when it comes to most things in life. But somehow when it comes to food, where I would assume it’s hardest for me to pick favorites given how much I savor eating everything, there is one dish that for me has always ruled supreme homestyle Bangladeshi chicken korma.

                            Of all my cravings, this is the most frequent. Of all my blissful childhood memories of food, this is the fondest.
                            
                            
                            This dish, for me, is associated with happiness, celebration, and love. The sweet aroma of cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks and onions caramelizing in ghee (clarified butter) that fills the kitchen as I set out to make this, is one that automatically triggers joyful memories of my childhood. I have so many happy recollections of waking up on Eid mornings to find my mother fussing over a pot of this delightfully fragrant chicken korma with its slightly sweet-savory and nutty gravy, to be mopped up with homemade porotas (buttery South Asian flatbread) for breakfast/brunch first and then eaten alongside polao (Bengali rice pilaf) and many other dishes that are prepared later on throughout the day. There are memories of coming home to find chicken korma simmering away on the stove for impromptu weekend gatherings or small family celebrations. And equally countless memories, some tinged with guilt (and shame, in admitting this), of staying up late on weekends to sneakily indulge in leftovers and a movie well past midnight when guests from my parents’ dawats would have been long gone. My mom knows how much I enjoy this dish, and when I visit my family in Dhaka now, she lovingly makes sure it’s always at the table for my first and last meals at home, as well as many more in between. So whenever I make this dish at home in New York, even if it is only for myself, it always feels like a special occasion and a treat.
                            
                            Every Bangladeshi/Bengali family probably has its own version of chicken korma, the way every South Asian household has its own chicken curry recipes that are unique in their own way. Some people omit chilies, others add raisins and nuts, while yet others will add ground poppy seed paste or use “mishti doi” (Bengali sweet yogurt) instead of regular yogurt. My mom makes hers with a spice paste that she grinds herself at home. Lazy kin, I make do with store-bought powdered spices. This is quite different from what my mother makes, I’ve simplified the cooking approach a bit while trying to ensure that it still reminds me of the childhood korma that I grew up with.
