                        <p>A country’s cuisine they say is to know by means of the recipe; the customs and the richness or poverty of a place, and the spirit of those who inhabit it. It is, above all, to participate in the symbolic celebration of the shared repast. Bangladesh- “The country of Bengal” is one of our neighbours,In order to break the myth of Bangladeshi cuisine being nothing but an extension of our Indian cuisine the “Home Chef Series” of Jyran (Sofitel, Mumbai, Maharashtra ) brought out recipes to depict the rich cultural heritage, medieval literature and riverine geography of Bangladesh. Resident Chef Nayana Afroz who herself hails from Dhaka described the striking difference between the two cuisines. She explained that Bangladeshi food is all about the usage of roasted cumin while in India we use raw cumin. Fish being one of the staples in the country is consumed both cooked as well as in sun dried form. Bangladesh is not only rich in its culture, but its cuisine sings highly about great amounts of spices used in the myriad preparations. The Chef laughingly remarked how she had to tone down the spice level to suit the taste buds of her guests during the festival.
