                        <p>I’m the type of indecisive person who can never pick favorites when it comes to most things in life. But somehow when it comes to food, where I would assume it’s hardest for me to pick favorites given how much I savor eating everything, there is one dish that for me has always ruled supreme homestyle Bangladeshi chicken korma.

                            Of all my cravings, this is the most frequent. Of all my blissful childhood memories of food, this is the fondest.
                            
                            
                            This dish, for me, is associated with happiness, celebration, and love. The sweet aroma of cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks and onions caramelizing in ghee (clarified butter) that fills the kitchen as I set out to make this, is one that automatically triggers joyful memories of my childhood. I have so many happy recollections of waking up on Eid mornings to find my mother fussing over a pot of this delightfully fragrant chicken korma with its slightly sweet-savory and nutty gravy, to be mopped up with homemade porotas (buttery South Asian flatbread) for breakfast/brunch first and then eaten alongside polao (Bengali rice pilaf) and many other dishes that are prepared later on throughout the day. There are memories of coming home to find chicken korma simmering away on the stove for impromptu weekend gatherings or small family celebrations. And equally countless memories, some tinged with guilt (and shame, in admitting this), of staying up late on weekends to sneakily indulge in leftovers and a movie well past midnight when guests from my parents’ dawats would have been long gone. My mom knows how much I enjoy this dish, and when I visit my family in Dhaka now, she lovingly makes sure it’s always at the table for my first and last meals at home, as well as many more in between. So whenever I make this dish at home in New York, even if it is only for myself, it always feels like a special occasion and a treat.
                            
                            Every Bangladeshi/Bengali family probably has its own version of chicken korma, the way every South Asian household has its own chicken curry recipes that are unique in their own way. Some people omit chilies, others add raisins and nuts, while yet others will add ground poppy seed paste or use “mishti doi” (Bengali sweet yogurt) instead of regular yogurt. My mom makes hers with a spice paste that she grinds herself at home. Lazy kin, I make do with store-bought powdered spices. This is quite different from what my mother makes, I’ve simplified the cooking approach a bit while trying to ensure that it still reminds me of the childhood korma that I grew up with.

                    <h2>What is Bangladeshi cuisine? The classic spices, staples and desserts of Bangladesh</h2>

                        <p>The concept of Bangladeshi food can be a confusing one. Your local ‘Indian’ curry house serves neither authentic Indian food nor Bangladeshi – despite the fact many are owned by people from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi food is distinct and delicious, with an emphasis on flavoursome spices, heat and fish. Here’s everything you need to know about. Bangladeshi food is often referred to as Bengali food, as the state of Bengal has existed long before the formation of Bangladesh in 1971.

                            Partition and the independence of India divided Bengal along religious lines (Hindu/Muslim) and flavours slowly evolved to become more distinct.
                            
                            Dishes native to both West Bengal and Bangladesh share some similarities, however, the biodiversity of Bangladesh as a low lying country of many rivers determines what is eaten, and when.
                            
                            South East Asian influences from bordering Myanmar can be tasted along the Chittagong Hill Tracts; think dried fish, coconut and sweet and sour combinations.</a> </p>

                        <p>A country’s cuisine they say is to know by means of the recipe; the customs and the richness or poverty of a place, and the spirit of those who inhabit it. It is, above all, to participate in the symbolic celebration of the shared repast. Bangladesh- “The country of Bengal” is one of our neighbours,In order to break the myth of Bangladeshi cuisine being nothing but an extension of our Indian cuisine the “Home Chef Series” of Jyran (Sofitel, Mumbai, Maharashtra ) brought out recipes to depict the rich cultural heritage, medieval literature and riverine geography of Bangladesh. Resident Chef Nayana Afroz who herself hails from Dhaka described the striking difference between the two cuisines. She explained that Bangladeshi food is all about the usage of roasted cumin while in India we use raw cumin. Fish being one of the staples in the country is consumed both cooked as well as in sun dried form. Bangladesh is not only rich in its culture, but its cuisine sings highly about great amounts of spices used in the myriad preparations. The Chef laughingly remarked how she had to tone down the spice level to suit the taste buds of her guests during the festival.
